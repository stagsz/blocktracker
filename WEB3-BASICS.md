# Web3 Basics - Understanding Your First Web3 App

A beginner-friendly guide to understand what's happening in BlockTracker.

## What is Web3?

**Web3** = The internet powered by blockchain technology

- **Web1** (1990s): Read-only websites (news, blogs)
- **Web2** (2000s): Interactive websites (Facebook, YouTube) - **centralized**
- **Web3** (2020s): Decentralized apps (crypto, NFTs) - **user-owned**

## Core Concepts

### 1. Blockchain

Think of it as a **public ledger** (accounting book) that everyone can see but no one can cheat.

- **Block**: A batch of transactions (like a page in a ledger)
- **Chain**: Blocks linked together chronologically
- **Distributed**: Copies exist on thousands of computers worldwide

**Ethereum** = A blockchain that can run programs (smart contracts)

### 2. Wallet Address

Your **digital identity** on the blockchain.

```
Format: 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
         â†‘                                       â†‘
         Always starts with 0x                   42 characters total
```

**What is it?**
- Like a bank account number (but public!)
- Anyone can send you crypto at this address
- Only you can spend from it (with your private key)

**Examples**:
- `0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045` = Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum founder)
- `0x47ac0Fb4F2D84898e4D9E7b4DaB3C24507a6D503` = Binance Hot Wallet

### 3. Transactions

**What happens when you send crypto**:

1. You sign a transaction with your private key (proves it's you)
2. Transaction gets broadcast to the network
3. Miners/validators verify it's legitimate
4. Transaction gets added to a block
5. Block gets added to the blockchain (permanent!)

**Transaction contains**:
- `from`: Sender address
- `to`: Receiver address
- `value`: Amount of ETH sent
- `gas`: Fee paid to miners
- `hash`: Unique transaction ID

### 4. ETH (Ether)

The **native currency** of Ethereum.

**Units**:
- 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei (18 zeros!)
- **Wei**: Smallest unit (like cents for dollars)
- **Gwei**: Common for gas prices (1 Gwei = 1 billion Wei)

**Why so many units?**
So you can send tiny amounts precisely (e.g., 0.000000001 ETH)

### 5. Smart Contracts

**Programs that run on the blockchain**.

Think of them as:
- Vending machines (put money in, get item out - automatic!)
- Self-executing contracts (no middleman needed)
- Code that can hold money

**Examples**:
- **ERC-20 Token**: A standard for creating crypto tokens (like USDC, DAI)
- **NFT Contract**: Creates and manages digital collectibles
- **DeFi Protocol**: Automated lending/borrowing platform

**Contract Address**:
```
0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F = DAI Stablecoin Contract
```

### 6. Tokens

**Digital assets created on Ethereum** (not ETH itself).

**Types**:
- **ERC-20**: Fungible tokens (like money - all units are identical)
  - Examples: USDC, LINK, UNI
- **ERC-721**: Non-fungible tokens (NFTs - each is unique)
  - Examples: CryptoPunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club
- **ERC-1155**: Mixed (one contract can have both types)

### 7. Gas

**Fee you pay** to execute transactions and run smart contracts.

**Why needed?**
- Pays miners/validators for computing power
- Prevents spam attacks (costs money to clog the network)
- Prioritizes transactions (higher gas = faster processing)

**Example**:
```
Simple ETH transfer: ~21,000 gas (~$5-$50 depending on network congestion)
Complex smart contract: ~100,000+ gas (~$20-$200+)
```

### 8. Provider (RPC)

**Your connection to the blockchain**.

Think of it as:
- An API that lets you read blockchain data
- A translator between your app and Ethereum network

**What we use**:
```javascript
// Alchemy = Our provider (the middleman)
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider('https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/YOUR_KEY');

// Now we can ask questions:
const balance = await provider.getBalance('0x...');
```

**Why not connect directly?**
- Running a full Ethereum node requires 1TB+ storage and constant syncing
- Providers like Alchemy do this for you (free tier is generous!)

## How BlockTracker Works

Let's trace what happens when you analyze a wallet:

### Step 1: User Input
```javascript
User enters: 0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045
```

### Step 2: Connect to Provider
```javascript
// web3-service.js
this.provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(alchemyUrl);
```
â†’ We connect to Alchemy's servers

### Step 3: Fetch Wallet Balance
```javascript
const balanceWei = await this.provider.getBalance(address);
```
â†’ Alchemy queries Ethereum blockchain
â†’ Returns balance in Wei (e.g., 1500000000000000000 = 1.5 ETH)

### Step 4: Convert to ETH
```javascript
const balanceEth = ethers.formatEther(balanceWei);
// "1500000000000000000" â†’ "1.5"
```

### Step 5: Fetch Transaction History
```javascript
// Use Etherscan API (separate service)
const url = 'https://api.etherscan.io/api?module=account&action=txlist&address=...';
```
â†’ Etherscan has indexed all transactions
â†’ Returns last 10 transactions as JSON

### Step 6: Display Results
```javascript
// app.js
elements.walletBalance.textContent = "1.5 ETH";
elements.walletTxCount.textContent = "1,234";
```
â†’ Updates the UI with formatted data

### Step 7: Generate AI Prompt
```javascript
// helpers.js
const prompt = generateAIPrompt(data, 'wallet');
```
â†’ Creates structured prompt for deeper analysis

## Code Walkthrough

### File Structure
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html              # UI (buttons, inputs, display)
â”œâ”€â”€ css/styles.css          # Styling (colors, layout)
â”œâ”€â”€ js/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app.js              # Main logic (handles button clicks)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ web3-service.js     # Blockchain queries (ethers.js wrapper)
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ helpers.js          # Utility functions (formatting, validation)
```

### Key Functions

**1. Initialize Provider**
```javascript
// web3-service.js
async initialize() {
  const alchemyUrl = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/${this.alchemyKey}`;
  this.provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(alchemyUrl);
}
```
â†’ Creates connection to Ethereum network

**2. Get Wallet Info**
```javascript
async getWalletInfo(address) {
  const balanceWei = await this.provider.getBalance(address);
  const balanceEth = ethers.formatEther(balanceWei);
  const txCount = await this.provider.getTransactionCount(address);
  return { address, balance: balanceEth, txCount };
}
```
â†’ Queries blockchain for basic wallet data

**3. Validate Address**
```javascript
// helpers.js
function isValidAddress(address) {
  const regex = /^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/;
  return regex.test(address);
}
```
â†’ Checks if address format is correct

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I see anyone's wallet balance?
**A:** Yes! Blockchains are public by design. Anyone can see:
- Wallet balances
- Transaction history
- Smart contract code

BUT you cannot:
- Spend someone else's funds (need private key)
- See who owns the wallet (unless they reveal it)

### Q: Is this real money?
**A:** Yes (on mainnet) and No (on testnet):
- **Mainnet**: Real ETH with real value ($1000s per ETH)
- **Sepolia/Testnet**: Free test ETH with zero value (for learning)

Start with Sepolia! Get free test ETH from faucets.

### Q: What's the difference between ethers.js and Web3.js?
**A:** Both are libraries to interact with Ethereum:
- **ethers.js**: Modern, lightweight, better docs (we use this!)
- **Web3.js**: Older, more bloated, but still popular

### Q: Why do I need Alchemy AND Etherscan?
**A:**
- **Alchemy**: Raw blockchain data (balances, contract calls)
- **Etherscan**: Indexed/processed data (transaction history, verified contracts)

Think of Alchemy as the blockchain itself, Etherscan as Google for blockchain.

### Q: Can I make money with this tool?
**A:** Not directly - this is an **intelligence tool**. But you can:
- Analyze your own portfolio
- Research before buying NFTs
- Investigate suspicious wallets
- Learn blockchain development (valuable skill!)

## Next Learning Steps

1. **Try the app**: Analyze different wallets (Vitalik, exchanges, NFT traders)
2. **Read the code**: Open `src/js/web3-service.js` and follow along
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code (change colors, add features)
4. **Build more**: Create your own Web3 projects!
